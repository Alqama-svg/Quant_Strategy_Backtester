Overview:
----------
This document summarizes important contextual and interpretive notes
associated with the QuantX V4.9 backtest, report, and data outputs.

1. Strategy Overview:
   QuantX V4.9 implements an intraday mean-reversion framework using
   standardized Z-score deviations between price and a short-term moving
   average. All trades are intraday, with no overnight exposure.

2. Leverage:
   No leverage was used during this backtest. All capital allocations
   were based on a nominal capital of $1,000,000.

3. Equity Curve Start Date:
   The equity curve begins on 2024-01-08 because the rolling window
   indicators required a warm-up period to produce valid signals.

4. Data Source:
   Proprietary intraday OHLCV data (5-minute resolution) for 32 large-cap
   U.S. equities, primarily from the Dow 30 universe.

5. Sharpe Ratio Clarification:
   The strategy-level backtest engine Sharpe (≈2.36) and QuantStats Sharpe
   (≈0.12) differ due to frequency and annualization factors.
   The backtest Sharpe is computed on intraday trade-level returns,
   whereas QuantStats annualizes daily returns.

7. Known Visualization Artifacts:
   Some raw ticker charts displayed vertical lines due to missing or zero
   price data points. These were cleaned using data filtering.

8. Future Enhancements:
   Potential extensions include regime-based thresholding, portfolio-level
   risk budgeting, and reinforcement learning-based execution scheduling.
